# Discussion

## Current Status

We have a Campaign page where we want to render different components depending on the data that we are receiving.

The current data is fake, but it mimics what the actual backend is returning.

We want to clean this data and convert it to something understandable and easy to follow. Also, we want to keep in
mind that more variations can come in the future, so it should be open for extension and modification.

Our plan is to do the following:
- Transform the data from the API (fake in this project).
- Try to do it in the server instead of the client.

Important files are:
- [Complexity Page](pages/Page.tsx)
- [Types](types/index.ts)

## Possible solutions

We can use this block in order to explain possible solutions and discuss them.
